# Fundgrube notifier

This project notifies you about current offers from the German electronics retail chains Saturn and Media Markt in their
Fundgrube, that match specific conditions you can define.

## Usage

First, install the project and the required packages from the `requirements.txt`.
Next, create a file called `products.json` in the root directory of the project, and once it is filled, run
the `main.py`.
Entries in the file are created in JSON format and every JSON object can have the following attributes:

- terms: A list of terms that must be included in the name of the article (case-insensitive). Mandatory attribute.
- price: You will not get a notification, if this price is surpassed. Optional attribute.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "terms": ["sony", "tv"]
  },
  {
    "terms": ["playstation"],
    "price": 20
  }
]
```

You will get notification for every article with the terms "sony" and "tv" in the name regardless of its price and every
product with "playstation" that is 20â‚¬ or less.
